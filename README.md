## Prerequisites
- Semi-modern version of Unreal Engine (preferably 4 or greater).
- An IDE capable of building unreal engine projects. This process is well
documented (see [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CompilingProjects)). 
  - Visual Studio or
  - XCode
- Somewhat decent graphics cards.

## Game Concept
The idea of the game is that you are trapped in a room and need to find
a way out. The controls for moving the character around follow the typical
FPS type controls. That is:
- A, S, D, and W for moving and straffing.
- Mouse for looking / turning.
- Left shift or right mouse button to pick things up.
